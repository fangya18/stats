### M1: Study design
#### A study is only as good as the study design

>*You are the best statistician you know - Brian Healy*

1. Study Design
     - Experimental question- Define outcome, sources, analysis plan
        - What are we trying to learn?  PFS/ OS/ Relapse
        - How to prove this
    - Sample Population- Sample size, types of sample
       - Who are we going to study
       Potential Question: Female->Male, Adult -> Kids

2. Data Collection
     - What kind of data (DM,AE,Lab)
     Potential Question: Lab Batch/ Regions

3. Analysis of data
     - Result- was it effective? **Null Hypothesis**
     - Conclusion? to Whom it will apply? - Significance of effect/generalizability
       - One sample tests
       - t-test, wilcoxon test
       - ANOVA
       - Linear Regression
       - Log Rank
       - CMH
       - Chi Square
       - Logistic

**Population vs. Sample**

Sample: a Random and representative subset of Population 
-why: Cant take all the population
*Chance, Bias*- MA vs entire country/ entire pop vs super fans
-Sampling variability : variability from sample to sample
-CI: incorporate the uncertainty in the estimated mean
Goal: the sample is able to make an inference about the population

**Description vs. Inference**
1. Describe the data that has been collected
2. Describe statistical inference 

**Variable**
*A variable is something that measured in all of the people/ in our sample*
Examples:
Continuous variables: Age
Categorical :  - Binary : Sex, Event
                            - Nominal : Disease Grade, Race
                            -  Ordinal Variable: Mild/Moderate/Severe: Expression PD-L1
Time to Event: [[Survival]] Time

**Ways to express data**
Distribution:
- Numerical statistics: Describe data 
   - Summary statistics: 
     Location (min, max, mean, median, q1,q3)
   - Variability (Sd, variance)
   - Proportion
- Graphics: Display data
   - Scatter Plot
   - Bar plot/box plot
   -  histogram: symmetry/skewness
       a continuous variable break into bins
    - KM

Why we check the data distribution: to ensure the data quality !
- Height: meter, feet

Mean: arithmetic mean (age), geometric mean (pk concentration)
$$ \bar x =\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i} {n} $$
$$ \bar{x}= \sqrt{x_1*x_2*..x_i} $$

Median: is the middle number or 50% percentile
Interquartile range: 25-75

**Comparison**

- Categorical variable: Contingency Table
- Continuous variable: Correlation
  Correlation does not equal causation
  level of correlation matters in field (0.1 for social science, >0.9 physics, 0.5 clinical trails)

**Basic Analysis Lookup Table **

|   Outcome    | Variable   | Analysis  |
|------------  |----------  |-----------|
| Continuous   | Binary     | T-test, Wilcoxon, Fisher exact |\
| Continuous   | Categorical| ANOVA,Wilcoxon test            | \
| Continuous   | Continuous | Correlation, Linear Reg        |\
| Binary       | Binary     | Chi-square, Logistic Regression|\ 
| Binary       | Continuous | Logistic Regression            |\
| Time to Event| Binary     | Log-rank test|

>                                                      --Brian Healy*

**Outline**
1. Application
2. Conditional probability
3. Binomial Distribution
4. Normal Distribution
5. Central Limit Theorem and its property 

**Basic Probability Application**
Gambling odds
Weather forecast
Medical research

**Def:** Probability for an event is the relative frequency of this outcome over an infinitely large number of trials.
\
How likely is an event? 0<=Pr(x) <=1
\
$P(A)$, $P(\bar{A})$, $P(A \bigcup B)$ , $P(A\cap B)$ 

**Conditional Probability**
**Def:** Given that an event has occurred what is the probability of a second event?
* Sensitivity is an example of conditional probability
$$P(A|B)=\frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}$$
Mutually exclusive: P(A|B)
\
P(A|B)=P(A) +P(B) 
\
Exhaustive: P(A)+ P(nonA)=1
\
Independent: The occurrence of event B doesn't affect the probability occurrence of event A
\
coin toss
- P(A|B)=P(A)
- $P(A \cap B)= P(A)*P(B)$

**Diagnostic Tests**
- Sensitivity + False negative =1
   - *Sensitivity:* P(T+|D+)
   - *False negative* P(T-|D+)
- Specificity + False positive =1
   - *Specificity:* P(T-|D- )
   - *False positive:* P(T+|D-)

**Probability Distribution**

- **Binomial Distribution** : Discrete distribution for the number of successes (X) in a specific number of independent trials.
 \
   n: number of trials
 \
   p: probability of success on each trial
\
Expected Value= Mean= E(x)= np
\
$Application$: Confidence Interval, Hypothesis testing
   $$P(X=x)=\binom{n}{p}p^x(1-p)^{n-x}$$

**Normal Distribution**: The probability of a continuous random variable in symmetric shape being between two values of less/ greater than a value
\
range(-inf, inf)
\
mean: $\mu$
\
variance: $\sigma^2$
Feature: transform to **standard normal** distribution . p-value is tail probability
\
z-statistic, mean=0, sd=1
\
p(-1<=Z<=1)=0.68
\
p(-1.96<=Z<=1.96)=0.95
$$Z=\frac{X- \mu}{\sigma}$$

Case study: one person/ one event
\
Medical research: interested in the distribution of the mean of a group of people/observations

**Property of Mean** (Regardless of the data)

1. $E(s)=E(x)$ The distribution of sample is equal to the pop mean
2. $\sigma(s) = \frac{\sigma(p)}{\sqrt{Ns}}$  The sd of the distribution of the sample mean is equal to the sd of population divided by the square root of the sample size
     - standard error $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$ : variability in the distribution of the sample means
3. The distribution of the sample mean is normal
4.  $\sigma^2$ decrease as $n$ increase

**Math Equations**

Sample Mean:
$$E(\bar x)= E(\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i)=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n E(x_i)=\frac{1}{n}(n\mu)=\mu$$

Variance of Sample Mean:
$$Var(\bar x)= Var(\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i)=\frac{1}{n^2}\sum_{i=1}^n Var(x_i)=\frac{1}{n^2}(n\sigma^2)=\frac{\sigma^2}{n}$$

#### Central Limit Theorem
If x1,x2,...xn are n random samples drawn from a population with overall mean $\mu$ and finite variance $\sigma^2$,and sample mean $\bar X_n$ , then the limiting form of the distribution $Z=lim_{n-> \infty} \sqrt{n} \frac{\bar X_n - \mu}{\sigma}$is a standard normal distribution, regardless the original distribution.

- Take a sample, we know the distribution of the sample mean, regardless the original distribution.
The central limit theorem states that if you have a population with mean Œº and standard deviation œÉ and take sufficiently large random samples from the population [with replacement](javascript:void(0);)![](https://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/mph-modules/bs/bs704_probability/ada-reference.gif "text annotation indicator"), then the distribution of the sample means will be approximately normally distributed. This will hold true regardless of whether the source population is normal or skewed, provided the sample size is sufficiently large (usually n > 30

***Key Concept:*** the method to calculate the probability of single observation is the same as observed mean. (leading to p value)



### M3 Hypothesis Testing
Pivot Study: Technique to collect data
Survey: Small group first

**Outlines**
1. p-value
2. Hypothesis test
3. One Sample and two Sample t-test
4. Confidence intervals

*Review*
Motive: in addition to the specified probability for a specific event, we want to know the normal range.
EX, Blood pressure at 80 vs a normal range of blood pressure 56.5-103.5 
mean= 80, sd=12
95% of data in (56.5,103.5)

Real world application: 
Most of the time we don't know the parameters of a distribution

**Motif:**  we want to learn about a new group
- Hypothesis test
   Study design, how to measure the outcome
- Confidence interval

EX: MS (Multiple sclerosis) a neurologic disorder among young people
* Physical Disability, but cognitive difficulties 
Study Question: is the average cognitive function in patients with relapsing-remitting MS different than healthy controls?
How to measure ! Is the question fully answered?
SDMT: investigate in means
Sample: Representative of the population and random
Sample should be able to make a inference for the population

**Reasons of the differences between groups**:
- Actual effect- Treatment
- Chance: Flip a coin(2H, 5H, 20H?)
- Bias: fans vote, representative sample ! 
- Confounding

**Statistical Test:** Designed to determine if the observed difference between the groups was likely due to chance.

**Null Hypothesis**: (Initial belief) 
**Alternative Hypothesis:** 
- cover all values not included in the null
- contain the value that we think is going to happen

Fair Coin flip example:
H0: The probability of heads is 0.5
H1: The probability of heads is not 0.5

üìç**Hypothesis test** !!!üìç

Def: A statistical test of a null hypothesis completed under the assumption that the null is true (Conditional probability)
1. State Null hypothesis clearly
2. State the type of data (continuous, categorical, time to event, outcome, predictor)
3. Determine appropriate statistical test
4. State summary statistics (direction of the effect, better or worse)
5. Calculate P-value
6. Decide whether to reject null
7. Write conclusion

**Example**


**P-value:** P(Ha|H0=True)
the probability of the observed result or something more extreme given the null hypothesis is true.
\
a small enough p-value is statistically significant (traditionally 0.05=1/20 chance)
\
if p<0.05 we reject our null hypothesis and decide the event is unlikely to happen under the null.
\
***Type I error*** : P(R|H0=True)=0.05, Reject Null given Null is true
*  We assume 5% of the time we will be wrong
P(10head|fair coin)=1 -> Reject the null

***Normal Dis: P value come from Z stats***

Z test: know the sd and mean
T test: unkown sd , heavier tail
- Normal distribution+ independent event
- Is the observed mean different from the hypothesized mean relative to the variability in the data (x bar)?
$$t=\frac{ \bar x - \mu_0}{s/ \sqrt{n}} $$
